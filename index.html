      <!-- My Mission -->
      <section class="block" data-visual="v1">
        <h1>My mission</h1>
        <p>I started XERA Beauty to create bold, diverse makeup that does more than look good. It heals, nourishes, and empowers. For me, beauty is about expression, authenticity, and accountability.</p>

      <!-- My Story -->
      <section class="block" data-visual="v2">
        <h2>My story</h2>
        <p>I have been a performer and makeup artist for over twenty years, from drag to burlesque to theater. I know firsthand how frustrating it is to choose between skincare that feels good and makeup that lasts under lights, through sweat, and during long nights. That is why I decided to build XERA — products that deliver both.</p>

      <!-- What Makes XERA Different -->
      <section class="block" data-visual="v3">
        <h2>What makes XERA different</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Performance plus Care:</strong> I formulate with the same standards I need on stage. Theater grade longevity that still cares for your skin.</li>
          <li><strong>Inclusive by Design:</strong> I am building this brand for people like me — drag queens, performers, makeup enthusiasts, and everyday wearers who often do not see themselves represented in mainstream beauty.</li>
          <li><strong>Accountability Over Greenwashing:</strong> I do not use the word “sustainable” lightly. My goal is to create refillable systems and packaging that truly work, with honesty and transparency.</li>
          <li><strong>Fantasy Meets Reality:</strong> My first collection, the Lore Line, is inspired by fantasy creatures. It brings storytelling, artistry, and play into everyday makeup.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Coming Soon -->
      <section class="block" data-visual="v4">
        <h2>Coming soon</h2>
        <p>The first launch will be LipLore, a crystal clear, high shine lip lacquer that is transfer proof, waterproof, and never sticky. I am starting with four shades inspired by fantasy creatures — Dragon’s Blood, Mermaid Tears, Nymph Blessing, and Faerie Dreams.</p>
